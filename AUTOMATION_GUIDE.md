# 🤖 Autonomous Development Automation Guide

## Overview

Your Newsauto project is now equipped with a comprehensive autonomous development system that can work on issues, implement features, and make progress while you're away.

## 🎯 What's Been Set Up

### 1. **All Issues Assigned** ✅
- All 29 issues have been assigned to you (@dttb-capy)
- Issues are organized across 5 phases with milestones
- Priority labels help guide automation

### 2. **Autonomous Development Scripts** 🚀

#### A. Autonomous Developer (`scripts/autonomous_developer.py`)
Smart AI-powered developer that:
- Analyzes high-priority issues automatically
- Determines implementation strategy
- Creates appropriate code structure
- Runs tests and commits changes
- Updates issue status and comments

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 scripts/autonomous_developer.py
```

#### B. Development Army (`scripts/development_army.sh`)
Parallel development orchestration system that:
- Deploys multiple workers for different components
- Monitors progress across all phases
- Self-heals common issues
- Creates status dashboards

**Commands:**
```bash
# Deploy all workers once
./scripts/development_army.sh deploy

# Monitor current progress
./scripts/development_army.sh monitor

# Run self-healing checks
./scripts/development_army.sh heal

# Continuous development (10 iterations, 5 min intervals)
./scripts/development_army.sh continuous 10 300

# Create status dashboard
./scripts/development_army.sh dashboard
```

### 3. **GitHub Actions Workflows** ⚙️

#### A. Autonomous Development (`.github/workflows/autonomous-development.yml`)
- Runs every 2 hours automatically
- Analyzes priorities and implements solutions
- Can be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch
- Supports phase-specific work

**Manual Trigger:**
```bash
gh workflow run autonomous-development.yml
```

#### B. Project Automation (`.github/workflows/project-automation.yml`)
- Auto-adds new issues to project board
- Moves items through workflow states
- Updates project status automatically

#### C. Auto-Labeler (`.github/workflows/issue-labeler.yml`)
- Automatically labels issues based on title patterns
- Detects feature areas (llm, api, content-pipeline, etc.)
- Assigns priority based on keywords

### 4. **Project Structure**

#### Active Workers by Component:
1. **Database Worker** → Phase 1 Foundation
2. **API Worker** → Phase 1 Foundation (2 issues active)
3. **LLM Worker** → Phase 1 Foundation (1 issue active)
4. **Scrapers Worker** → Phase 2 Content Pipeline
5. **Newsletter Worker** → Phase 3 Newsletter System

## 📊 Current Status

**Progress Overview:**
- Total Issues: 29
- Open: 29
- Closed: 0
- Progress: 0%

**Next Actions:**
- Workers are commenting on assigned issues
- Autonomous developer will start implementation
- GitHub Actions will run every 2 hours

## 🔄 How to Use While Away

### Option 1: Let GitHub Actions Handle It (Recommended)
The workflows will run automatically every 2 hours. No action needed!

### Option 2: Trigger Continuous Development
```bash
# Run for 8 hours (every 30 minutes = 16 iterations)
./scripts/development_army.sh continuous 16 1800
```

### Option 3: Single Autonomous Run
```bash
python3 scripts/autonomous_developer.py
```

## 🛠️ What the Automation Does

### Issue Analysis
1. Fetches high-priority open issues
2. Prioritizes Phase 1 Foundation items
3. Analyzes issue type (database, API, LLM, scraper)
4. Determines implementation strategy

### Implementation
1. Creates appropriate directory structure
2. Generates boilerplate code
3. Implements core functionality
4. Adds tests where applicable

### Quality Assurance
1. Runs test suite (when available)
2. Checks for errors
3. Validates implementation

### Git Operations
1. Stages all changes
2. Creates descriptive commit message
3. Commits with issue reference
4. Pushes to remote (in workflows)

### Issue Management
1. Comments progress updates
2. Moves through project board states
3. Closes completed issues
4. Links commits to issues

## 📈 Monitoring Progress

### Check Automation Status
```bash
# View current status dashboard
cat AUTOMATION_STATUS.md

# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# View open issues by priority
gh issue list --label "priority:high" --state open
```

### Check GitHub Actions
```bash
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list --limit 10

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>
```

### Check Worker Comments
All workers comment on issues they're working on. Check issue comments for updates.

## 🔧 Self-Healing Features

The automation includes self-healing capabilities:

1. **Stale Branch Cleanup**: Removes old branches automatically
2. **Auto-Commit**: Commits any uncommitted work
3. **Dependency Check**: Verifies and installs requirements
4. **Error Recovery**: Gracefully handles failures

## 🎯 Expected Progress

Based on the automation setup, you should see:

**First 2 Hours:**
- 2-3 issues worked on
- Initial code structure created
- First commits pushed

**After 4-6 Hours:**
- Phase 1 Foundation significantly advanced
- Database models implemented
- API structure in place
- LLM integration started

**After 8+ Hours:**
- Phase 1 potentially complete
- Phase 2 Content Pipeline started
- Multiple components operational

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **GitHub Actions Free Tier**: Workflows respect 2,000 minutes/month limit
2. **Rate Limits**: Automation respects GitHub API rate limits
3. **Review Required**: Auto-generated code should be reviewed before production
4. **Manual Intervention**: Complex issues may need human review

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Automation Stops
```bash
# Check workflow status
gh run list --limit 5

# Re-run failed workflow
gh run rerun <run-id>

# Manual trigger
./scripts/development_army.sh deploy
```

### If Issues Aren't Progressing
```bash
# Check for errors
gh run view <latest-run-id> --log-failed

# Run locally for debugging
python3 scripts/autonomous_developer.py
```

### If You Need to Stop Automation
```bash
# Disable workflows in GitHub repo settings
# Or add [skip ci] to commit messages
```
